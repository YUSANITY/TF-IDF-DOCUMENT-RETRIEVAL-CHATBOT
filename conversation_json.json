These factors include the direct and indirect contributions by each party towards the matrimonial assets, the child? s or children? s needs and any agreement between the parties on the division of the matrimonial assets.

Currently I am in a process of divorce and wants to have a clearer picture of sole and joint custody.", "RESPONSE": "The Singapore Courts generally grant 4 types of custody: sole custody order, joint custody order, hybrid order and split custody order. Under a sole custody order, the parent granted sole custody of the child will be the sole decision maker for major decisions concerning the child. Under a joint custody order, both parents will be decision makers for major decisions concerning the child. Both parents will therefore need to communicate with one another and reach a consensus where key decisions are concerned. In other words, both parents have an equal say in the upbringing of the child. For hybrid orders, although one parent will be granted custody over the child, the custodial parent must consult the non-custodial parent on matters pertaining to the welfare of the child. Under a split custody order, custody of different siblings may be split between the parents. This, however, is not a common order by the Court."}, {"MESSAGE": "Can a husband fight for temporary custody or guardianship of his wife's daughter whom he raised and was led to believe he was the father, when his wife is deemed mentally unfit and the biological father is not registered on the birth cert?", "RESPONSE": "Yes."}, {"MESSAGE": "How can a lawyer tell court to establish a paternity test if the Father already accept the child is his?", "RESPONSE": "It is not clear who the lawyer is acting for and whose interest the lawyer is seeking to advance.

Joint custody allows you to make major decisions in your child's life, for eg, in his or her choice of school, religion, etc. However, by itself, joint custody does not assure you the right to visit your children on a regular basis. For that, you will need to have access rights granted by the court. As you have joint custody, it is likely that the court would also have made a decision on your access rights. Your right to visit your children will depend on the access rights granted by the court to you. As you have provided no details of such access rights, it is not possible for us to advise you on whether you can do what you have suggested."}, {"MESSAGE": "How do I see my children if the Court grants care and control to the other parent?", "RESPONSE": "The Court will generally grant an access order to ensure that the parent without care and control will get to see his or her children regularly.

If not, the Court may set a timetable for access or impose specific conditions to be complied with."}, {"MESSAGE": "Can my child choose who he or she wants to follow in a custody fight?", "RESPONSE": "No. Your child can express their views to the court but the court will make a decision that is in the best interests of the child.

Custody can be shared but care and control normally lies with one parent.The Court considers the welfare of the child (such as the child? s emotional and physical well-being) to be the most important factor when deciding custody, and care and control. Relevant factors include:-the role that each parent has played in the child? s life-the stability that each parent can offer the child-whether the child? s existing care arrangements can be left as they are-the child? s age: care and control of a very young child will normally lie with the mother-whether there are siblings: the Court tries if possible not to separate siblings-the child? s wishes, if he or she is old enough to express an independent opinion-the parent? s wishes, which comes second to the welfare of the child"}, {"MESSAGE": "how i defend myself if i being served with PPO .during counselling was inform by my lawyer to come to agreement with my wife by writing LOU.", "RESPONSE": "Your lawyer will guide you through the drafting of your affidavit.

Also, what type of corporal punishment is legal for parents to administer and under what conditions can", "RESPONSE": "It depends; by law, corporal punishment of children is unlawful where it causes the child unnecessary physical pain, suffering or injury, any emotional injury or injury to health or development. However, parental physical punishment that is not excessive and is used by way of correction is not legally regarded as family violence, and is hence to that extent unlikely to be unlawful."}, {"MESSAGE": "I am 19 years old and was recently involved in a fight with my parents.

Although the general principle is that hotels are bound to provide accommodation for fee-paying customers, but they are not bound to do so at all risks and all costs. For a start, hotels are mandated by regulations to refuse rooms to persons of bad character. Further, hotels also cannot permit any gaming, drunkenness, drug abuse or disorderly conduct to take place on its premises.

In another case, the guests? suitcases were ransacked. These constitute clear proof of theft. On the other hand, where there is no sign of forced entry, theft will be harder to proof. Indeed, in such cases, the guest may himself have been careless so as to afford the thief the easy opportunity to steal without much force or effort."}, {"MESSAGE": "What if you signed an agreement that hotel is not accountable for any loss of belongings? Are hotels allowed to do that?", "RESPONSE": "Singapore cases have held that such clauses are ineffective. This is because the basis of the hotel? s responsibility does not lie in a private contract between it and the guest. Rather, it is imposed upon the hotel as a matter of law and as such, the hotel cannot contract out of this requirement by way of a clause in a private agreement. At best, such notices is no more than a warning to the guest that they must do their part to take care of their things themselves."}, {"MESSAGE": "Are hotels liable to the belongings of their guests? Up to what extend?", "RESPONSE": "Yes, they are, but the extent of their liability depends on the circumstances. In law, the hotel is regarded as insurer of the belongings of his guests. Therefore, if such belongings are lost or stolen within the confines of the hotel, the hotel must make good to its guests any damage or loss to the belongings. However, the hotel may not be liable for the full extent of the guests? loss. The hotel can escape liability if it can show that the guest himself was careless and that the carelessness led to the loss of the belongings. Another way in which the hotel can escape liability is if it has put up a display limiting its liability. This display must follow the terms of section 3(1) of Innkeepers? Act. Where the display is properly exhibited in a conspicuous part of the hotel, then, subject to very few exceptions, the hotel? s liability to its guests will be limited to $500 only.

If the product you purchased is regulated under the Consumer Protection Fair Trading Act, then they are required to give you a five working days cooling off period.

The outlet relocated recently to another location of inconvenience. I requested for a refund but was rejected. Is it within my rights to claim for the refund?

If the provider fails to do so (meaning they don't explain anything to the customer), is", "RESPONSE": "Generally, a consumer is taken to have agreed to the terms on the agreement that he or she has signed.

Hence, there may not be any assets to repay you."}, {"MESSAGE": "If A enters into a contract with B to provide a service for payment, and B enters into a contract with C to \"resell\" the service in return for payment, can C sue A directly/vicariously?", "RESPONSE": "Since A is performing the service for C directly, C may have a claim against A under the tort of negligence, although C is unlikely to have a contractual claim but this depends on the exact terms of both contracts."}, {"MESSAGE": "Can I sell any product we got from overseas without a proper distributorship from the manufacturer?

Contract still valid?", "RESPONSE": "This depends on whether 'expenses incurred' induced the conclusion of the contract. The contract may be set aside for misrepresentation of the 'expenses incurred', but the party now seeking to set aside the contract must show that the misrepresentation had caused him or her to enter into the contract. It is also important to note that misrepresentation is difficult to prove in practice, and may involve other more difficult issues."}, {"MESSAGE": "Renovation contractor charged design fee, provided labour and materials which fail to meet minimum legal req.Legitimate?", "RESPONSE": "This depends on the contract that the renovation contractor signed with the homeowner. The terms of the contract generally set out what is expected of the renovation contractor in terms of labour and materials. There may be other legal requirements that apply, but the most relevant document is usually the contract, which governs the legal obligations and liabilities of both parties."}, {"MESSAGE": "Is it legal to take over the monthly instalments of someone else's car?", "RESPONSE": "A car loan is governed by an agreement between the lender and the borrower. The borrower is usually the owner of the car. As with any agreement, the car loan agreement can be varied so that a third party \"takes over\" the obligation of paying the instalments for the car loan. However, this must be agreed to by the lender, the borrower and the third party. Alternatively, the borrower / owner of the car can enter into a private agreement with the third party under which the third party agrees with the borrower / owner of the car to pay the instalments for the car loan. In such a case, the lender is not involved and the private agreement is strictly a relationship between the borrower / owner of the car and the third party only. The borrower / owner of the car remains liable to repay the car loan to the lender under the original car loan agreement. Therefore, if the third party fails to pay the instalments, the lender can have recourse to the borrower / owner of the car and may exercise the rights (if any) under the car loan agreement to take possession of the car. The borrower / owner of the car will have to enforce the private agreement against the third party separately."}, {"MESSAGE": "What if there is no written contract?", "RESPONSE": "It does not matter that the contract is not written. Contracts may be made orally or in writing. In addition, there need not be a formal contract as such; the agreement between the parties may be contained in a series of correspondence, such as emails or letters. Once there is an agreement between the parties, the ambit of the agreement must be determined. If the ambit is found to cover the issue in question, then there would be a breach if the supplier fails to provide goods or services provided for under the agreement. Even if the contract is silent on the quality of goods, various statutes imply the condition that the goods must be in sufficiently good condition or match their description. Hence, the lack of a written contract, or even the absence of specific terms as to the fitness of goods, is not necessarily fatal to a claim against a supplier for breach of contract."}, {"MESSAGE": "If the supplier supplies goods or services which do not match their description, can the consumer sue?", "RESPONSE": "Yes, the consumer will be able to sue for breach of contract. If the contract provides a description of the goods or services to be provided, that is a term of the contract that has to be satisfied by the supplier. If the supplier does not satisfy those terms, he would have breached the contract. Such breach of contract enables the consumer to sue either int the Small Claims Tribunal or a higher level court if the claim amount is sufficiently large."}, {"MESSAGE": "By when must the consumer commence any action under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act?", "RESPONSE": "Generally, the consumer must do so no later than 2 years from the date on which the unfair practice was alleged to take place."}, {"MESSAGE": "What action can a consumer take in instances of  unfair practice against him or her by a supplier of goods or services?", "RESPONSE": "The consumer can file an action with the Small Claims Tribunal. The Small Claims Tribunal is empowered by the Act to order the return of any money, property or any other item given by the consumer to the supplier; award the consumer damages to compensate for loss suffered as a result of the unfair practice; or direct the supplier to do certain acts to ensure that the consumer obtains the true value of his or her bargain."}, {"MESSAGE": "Does a consumer have any recourse against a supplier of goods or services who omits to provide key information?", "RESPONSE": "Yes. The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act accords the consumer some level of protection. A consumer who has been misled or deceived by the supplier of goods or services can sue the supplier for unfair practice.  ?Unfair practice? is defined widely under the Act and generally includes instances where the supplier? s silence amounts to misleading or deception of the consumer."}, {"MESSAGE": "A widower re-marries an Indonesian lady. Upon his death, the Indonesian lady went back to her home country (she's not a SPR nor SG citizen), without contact details. What happens to the property and his savings account all under his own name?", "RESPONSE": "If the deceased left behind a valid will, then the executor will carry out his instructions. If the deceased died without a will (also known as dying intestate), then Singapore's rules on intestate succession will determine the distribution of the deceased's estate (see section 7 of the Intestate Succession Act for the rules on distribution). Therefore, either the deceased's will or the rules on intestate succession will govern the distribution of the deceased's estate.You should note that certain property may not form part of the deceased's estate. For example, property held in a joint tenancy at the time of death will be solely held by the surviving joint tenant.

She does not want to pay for a will. Her intention is not to leave any money for A & C. Her money is deposited in the banks under the joint name of B & D. Will A & C have the right to challenge B", "RESPONSE": "There will be some amount of uncertainty in the absence of a will. First, if A&C; do not ever find out about the monies in the account, then they will not make a claim. Second, if they do find out, then it is for them to prove that the monies actually belongs to your mother. If they can, then the monies would properly be divided intestate which is effectively equally between all children. We suggest that your mother does a will if she wishes to avoid all risk."}, {"MESSAGE": "My uncle left no will. will his estate goes to his siblings in China?", "RESPONSE": "It depends on whether he has any spouse, children or surviving parents.

A deceased's estate will be divided in equal portions among the deceased's children, if the deceased does not have a spouse. In your case, your estate will go to your son, assuming you do not remarry and assuming you are survived by only the one mentioned son.

How should I phrase this clause?", "RESPONSE": "There are various problems and permutations in this. Generally, if you die while your grandchild is still a foetus, you cannot will property to him since he does not exist at the time of your death. You can circumvent this by willing the property to say his father in his lifetime then to any male children. As this is not straightforward and can result in the invalidation of your will, we recommend that you check with a lawyer. Alternatively, make your will after your grandchild is born."}, {"MESSAGE": "How many types of Will are there?

The main advantage to having a lawyer present (especially if the lawyer drafted the will) is that the lawyer can explain the contents of the will. That being said, the lawyer's explanation is not binding - he is just explaining his understanding of the will. If a dispute occurs as to the contents of the will (or the validity of the will), then the contents of the will speaks for itself and the beneficiaries will have to sort it out (in court or otherwise)."}, {"MESSAGE": "If the value of the deceased's assets is insufficient to cover the medical & nursing home debts, are the children liable to pay for it?", "RESPONSE": "If the children incurred or guaranteed the debts, they will be liable for the debts.

If so, then the insurance proceeds form part of the deceased's estate.

However, as a matter of law, the mother's entitlement to maternity leave (16 weeks under the CDSA) requires that the mother be lawfully married within 12 months of the child's birth. Hence, if that is not the case, then provided that the mother is not a managerial or executive position who earns a basic monthly salary of more than $4,500, she would only be entitled to 12 weeks maternity leave (8 weeks paid/4 weeks unpaid).She would not be entitled to baby bonus in any event as that requires that the mother be lawfully married."}, {"MESSAGE": "is it legal to be told to be on stand by over time work on an off day? and if cannot work on d day to find someone to cover also must pay back on next off some more for us to find replacement if applying AL.", "RESPONSE": "It is not clear what your query is.

It may be possible to avoid paying the  ?three month average salary? sum if this term in the contract is deemed to be a penalty clause. A clause is an unenforceable penalty where it is not a genuine pre-estimate of loss. Otherwise, any sum payable in a contract that is a genuine pre-estimate of loss is not a penalty and is therefore enforceable.

Company requires me to pay sum back to them when nothing was investment in me in the first place. Is this enforceable?", "RESPONSE": "Was the sum stipulated in the contract? If so, it is possible to avoid paying if this term in the contract is deemed to be a penalty clause. Any sum payable in a contract that is a genuine pre-estimate of loss is not a penalty and is therefore enforceable. If there is a very large difference between the actual loss suffered by the company and the contractual sum, you may wish to consult a lawyer as the contractual term may be unenforceable as a penalty. If the sum was not stipulated in the contract, then the burden is on the company to prove that it had incurred a loss due to the breach of the contract."}, {"MESSAGE": "I signed an employment contract with a company to render services to their client.

As small tribunal court does not have Lawyers, will the agency be able to have a lawyer present them and sue me elsewhere", "RESPONSE": "Lawyers are not allowed to represent any of the parties in Small Claims Tribunals proceedings. The recruitment firm therefore cannot be represented by a lawyer at the Hearing. The recruitment firm can be represented by a lawyer if it appeals against the decision made by the Small Claims Tribunal Registrar, Assistant Registrar or Referee who has heard the matter. The recruitment firm may only appeal against an order from the Small Claims Tribunal to the High Court in limited circumstances: on any ground involving a question of law; or on the ground that the claim was outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It is unlikely that leave (permission) will be given to the recruitment firm to make such an appeal to the High Court.As regards the penalty of one month? s salary, it is possible to avoid paying if this term in the contract is deemed to be a penalty clause.

Most importantly, you should check if your contract provides for any remedies or damages if you were to tender resignation before 30th June. If not, then tendering resignation may mean the act of giving notice, and therefore you may be obligated under the contract to only give your 2 months' notice on 30th June, with your last day being 31st August.

Is it legal to impose such large fines?", "RESPONSE": "It is possible to avoid paying if this term in the contract is deemed to be a penalty clause. Any sum payable in a contract that is a genuine pre-estimate of loss is not a penalty and enforceable. However, the payment stipulated in your contract (3 months of salary) does not seem to be a penalty clause in that it is likely considered as a genuine pre-estimate of loss for the employer, particularly since the employment contract is fairly long (3 years).

If $50,000 is the amount of money equivalent to the salary that you would have earned during the required notice period under the contract, then you may indeed have to pay such an amount if you choose to terminate the contract without waiting for the notice period to end.

Where the restrictive covenant does not have a set time limit, the court may either strike down the covenant as unreasonable, or potentially impose a time limitation that is deemed to be reasonable in the circumstances."}, {"MESSAGE": "terminating my bond contract but contract states that compensation is full course fees + 4 months salary (with or without notice). company only paid 30% of course fees as it was subsidized by WDA. what is the reasonable amount that i should repay for term", "RESPONSE": "The amount that you will be required to repay is based on your contract - hence, unless the contractual term is viewed as a penalty, you will be required to repay the full amount. If the clause is unenforceable, then they can only claim their loss."}, {"MESSAGE": "I am an unmarried woman who had an affair with another woman who was my subordinate married with kids. Her husband found and complained. I was terminated for misconduct though it was mutual. Is that justified? Also no action was taken against her.", "RESPONSE": "This depends on the terms of your contract and your company's policies. It is common for many companies to terminate their employees if they have an affair with their subordinates and this is viewed as an abuse of power. It is also common for no action to be taken against the subordinate as they are not abusing their power."}, {"MESSAGE": "I signed an employment acceptance letter with a job agency. The words \"bleaching this term\" are used instead of \"breaching this term\". Is this employment acceptance letter still enforceable? Am I liable to pay any fee to the agency ?", "RESPONSE": "Yes."}, {"MESSAGE": "On turning 62 years in Jun 2016, my employer did not discuss with me on rehiring. Two months later they terminated me citing restructuring and did not pay me compensation.", "RESPONSE": "We suggest that you make a representation to the Minister. This must be done no later than one month after the last date of your employment. Please see http://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retirement for more details."}, {"MESSAGE": "in my employment contract, it states (exact wording) must provide 2 months advance notice and penalty charges of one month's salary are the penalty charges enforceable?", "RESPONSE": "The penalty charges are only unenforceable if it stipulates an excessive amount of money to be paid upon the breach of the employment contract. This then depends on what work you are doing to asses the proportionality. It does not seem that the clause is a penalty clause in this case however."}, {"MESSAGE": "I'm still working as a Production Manager with 5.6k monthly salary. Salaries are never on time and now nearly 16k outstanding, all our employees facing this because of company financial problem. Can I go to MOM or what are other options do I have?", "RESPONSE": "You will not be considered an employee for the purpose of the Employment Act. However, you can still go to the MOM for assistance, although if all the employees are facing the same problem, then you should go as a group. Alternatively, you can make a civil claim against the employer."}, {"MESSAGE": "Can my employer state on my employment contract that i should bear both employer and employee CPF? Is this enforceable?", "RESPONSE": "While this depends on how the clause is drafted, it is generally not enforceable as the employer's portion is to be borne by the employer."}, {"MESSAGE": "My employee has lost an equipment that cost $4500. He is a low salaried worker and does not want to pay for the loss. Is there any recourse for the employer? By the way he has tendered his resignation.", "RESPONSE": "The main recourse is to take legal action against the employee. However, if he is low salaried, then there may not be even effective recourse since you may not be able to recover any damages from him."}, {"MESSAGE": "Contract states that Approved Overtime work is paid for any work done after 44working hours/week.If the contract start on a friday and i worked more than 9 hours/day[in excess of the normal hours of work] until sunday(But less than 44 hours).Am i entitled", "RESPONSE": "if the contract does not provide for the prorating of the 44 working hours/week limit, then you will likely not be entitled to overtime pay as you did not work more than 44 working hours in that week."}, {"MESSAGE": "At my previous employment, i was forced to clear all of my annual leaves (21 days) before being asked to leave the company. Upon resignation, the company demanded to recover money for the excess leave taken. I feel that it is very unfair and I wonder", "RESPONSE": "Assuming that you only took the number of days of annual leave which is your contractual entitlement, it is likely that the company would be unable to recover money for excess leave taken. As such, you should refuse to pay the company or should demand your full salary, if they have deducted the amount from your salary."}, {"MESSAGE": "If contract stated cannot tender resignation till 30Jun and i resign with 2 months notice, last day 31 Jul, do i break bond n needs to compensate?", "RESPONSE": "It depends on your specific employment contract. Most importantly, you should check if your contract provides for any remedies or damages if you were to tender resignation before 30th June. If not, then tendering resignation may mean the act of giving notice, and therefore you may be obligated under the contract to only give your 2 months' notice on 30th June, with your last day being 31st August. If this is the case, then you may have to work until 31st August or pay your employer an additional 1 month's salary in lieu of notice to terminate the contract on 31st July before the notice period has ended, as you have described."}, {"MESSAGE": "Is it possible to terminate a 3yr employment contract without paying the stipulated and unreasonably inflated 3 month worth of salary as penalty fee? Is it legal to impose such large fines?", "RESPONSE": "It is possible to avoid paying if this term in the contract is deemed to be a penalty clause. Any sum payable in a contract that is a genuine pre-estimate of loss is not a penalty and enforceable. However, the payment stipulated in your contract (3 months of salary) does not seem to be a penalty clause in that it is likely considered as a genuine pre-estimate of loss for the employer, particularly since the employment contract is fairly long (3 years). As such, if you do wish to terminate your employment contract, you will likely have to pay the agreed sum."}, {"MESSAGE": "Am i liable for a job's non commencement penalty after i backed out from the offer 1 day after signing? The offer letter's approval is subjected to a security clearance, which i have not submitted documents for the clearance.", "RESPONSE": "This will depend on the exact phrasing and terms used in the contract you have signed. If the monetary compensation stipulated in the contract is an extravagant amount, there is a possibility that the non-commencement clause will be held to be a penalty clause and made unenforceable. The Employment Act does not apply to the contract as you are not in an employer-employee relationship since you have not started work. Any claim against you from the workplace you have turned down will have to be a civil claim."}, {"MESSAGE": "I have told my agency on the 4th day of training under probation period that i want to resign. She insists me to help her for a couple of days. And i helped her and after that she send me a letter for breaching contract. I have to pay a sum of money.

If the contract stipulates that a sum is payable on your resignation, then you would have to fulfill your obligation to pay."}, {"MESSAGE": "Need help urgently.My boss is threatening that if i were to leave my current job then 50k singapore dollars will have to be payable before the employment contract mature. We signed a contract and i did not receive a", "RESPONSE": "If the clause is stated in the contract which you agreed to, you have to perform your obligations under the contract. If $50,000 is the amount of money equivalent to the salary that you would have earned during the required notice period under the contract, then you may indeed have to pay such an amount if you choose to terminate the contract without waiting for the notice period to end. This is because you would need to pay the other party compensation in lieu of notice."}, {"MESSAGE": "I have signed an employment contract that states that I have to stay in employment of the company for a certain period. However it is not written in the contract that there will be a penalty for breaking that. Can I resign before the stated period withou", "RESPONSE": "You may resign at anytime. However, you need to give advanced notice of your intention to terminate the employment to your employer. The notice period should be according to you employment contract, or verbal agreement. If it is not mentioned in your employment contract, you can refer to the Ministry of Manpower's website for more information on how much advanced notice should be given (http://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/termination-of-employment/termination-with-notice). Alternatively, you may also terminate the contract without notice. You would then have to pay compensation in lieu of notice, or a \"notice pay\" (which is the money equivalent to the salary that you would have earned during the required notice period).If your contract does not require you to pay for monetary compensation (in addition to the notice pay) for terminating a contract before the specified period, then it is unlikely that you would have to pay money for resigning before the stated period apart from the notice pay if you terminate without notice."}, {"MESSAGE": "Hi, a recruitment agency informd me a day before starting new job that my role was made redundent. What recourse do i have? The role made me relocate back to Singapore", "RESPONSE": "Your agreement with the recruitment agency will be governed by the contract that you have with them when they offer you the job. To understand your rights (and recourse), you will need to review the contract and demonstrate that the contract was breached. If so, you can then claim the damages 9e.g. cost of relocation) from the recruitment agency."}, {"MESSAGE": "Can my employer dismiss my employment if I refuse to work overtime when asked?", "RESPONSE": "This depends on the circumstances of your employment (such as your position, etc), the nature of your employment contract, etc. If your case falls under the Employment Act, you may have a case for unfair dismissal depending on your situation.

Job Agt ask me to compensate", "RESPONSE": "A contract, once signed, is legally binding. Employment contracts may legitimately ask for compensation if the applicant does not follow through. In such cases, it is likely that you will have to compensate, although this ultimately depends on the specific contents of your contract."}, {"MESSAGE": "In the context of signing a scholarship deed, is a letter of undertaking legally binding? Before I signed the contract, I signed a letter of undertaking and thus decided against signing the contract. The company now wants me to compensate them for ad", "RESPONSE": "This depends on the nature of the 'letter of undertaking'. Some documents signed before the formal contract are expressly 'subject to contract'. In such cases, those documents do not bind both parties formally. It therefore depends on what your 'letter of undertaking' is."}, {"MESSAGE": "Is employer allow to auto-offset employee's salary for the subsidised course fee for a 12 month training program?", "RESPONSE": "If you (assuming you are the employee) agreed to attend a paid training programme, you have a contractual obligation to pay the training fees. The terms of the training programme agreement may provide for contractual set-off, where your employer may pay your salary net of the your training fees. Even if the contract does not explicitly provide for set-off, based on the doctrine of equitable set-off, your employer? s obligation to pay your salary may be set-off against your training fees. Where equitable set-off is concerned, both debts must be due and payable. This means that your employer can only set-off your salary when it is time for you to pay the training fees. An additional requirement is that both debts must be mutual. This requirement is fulfilled in your situation."}, {"MESSAGE": "Hi, I have not been paid 5 months of salary from my employer. I am a cook working in a restaurant in Sg, and I am supposed to be paid 2.5k a month. My employer has not been paying for CPF as well and he has been summoned to court for this issue. However,", "RESPONSE": "Since your claim amount is below the limit for the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (\"TADM\"), you can file a salary claim with the TADM.

An aggrieved employee may wish to appeal to the Ministry of Manpower for unfair dismissal."}, {"MESSAGE": "Can employer refuse paying overtime allowance or collect back overtime allowance paid?", "RESPONSE": "It depends on what was agreed upon in the employment contract.

If you are covered by the Employment Act (i.e. your salary does not exceed S$4,500), then it would also be a regulatory offence. If they fail to pay you your salary, you can make a complaint to the MOM or you can commence a claim against your employer."}, {"MESSAGE": "Is there any protection for Whistleblowers in Singapore? Raised COI issues concerning some Management Staff. Company indicated that they do not want to pursue matter. 3 months later, company taking actions to terminate me by indicating that they no longer", "RESPONSE": "There is no legislation explicitly providing protection for whistleblowers.

What recourse do they have?", "RESPONSE": "If the Caf?? is closing down, then they are likely to have little recourse as the Caf?? may not have any real assets to repay them. This is on the assumption that the Caf?? is held and operated by a company (as opposed to a sole proprietor) as the shareholder/directors are unlikely to be liable in such a situation."}, {"MESSAGE": "I ws sacked frm a job, I hv filed claims, non payment of salary in lieu of notice, PHs wid labour court, Director is denying to pay after 2 inquiry sessions, nw d case hs been scheduled fr hearing, hw many hearings wil it take?

First, under the Work Place Compensation regime, compensation is payable (regardless of fault) when an employee suffered an injury by an accident arising out of and in the course of employment. It is unclear from your question whether you fell while you were attending the training or while you were on your way home. However, under the Work Place Compensation regime, you will not be entitled to compensation if you suffered the injury while you were travelling to and fro between home and workplace (unless this is on the Company provided transport). Further, you must make this claim within 1 year of your accident.

In this case, could I leave the company immediately without serving the notice p", "RESPONSE": "The question of breach depends on the specific terms of your contract. If the contract provides for payment to be made on the 7th, then it would be a breach. The fact that your contract has been breached would entitle you to damages. Whether it allows you to terminate the agreement is a separate issue. If the notice period is one month, then you would effectively be able to set off the monies owed to you against the notice period in any event.

What is the consequences if we are unable to pay the fine?

Will my declaration of bankrupt affect her", "RESPONSE": "It is unlikely that your financial status would affect your wife's citizenship. Furthermore, from your description of the events, the citizenship ceremony would be a mere formality to your wife's citizenship rather than a necessary step. Therefore, your wife is already a Singaporean. However, if her application for citizenship had contained a false declaration of your financial status, it could affect her citizenship status."}, {"MESSAGE": "my spouse is in credit card debts and cannot pay up. She is a Private Hire Grab driver and we set up a Partnership company with the only asset in the partnership being the car. Will creditors possess the car in this instance if she is made a bankrupt?", "RESPONSE": "It is unclear if you have formed a partnership or company (e.g. Private Limited).

It must be the  ?clearest of cases? that the original owner has  ?a specific and unequivocal intention? to abandon the property in question. In your situation, the most relevant factors likely are the nature of the items and the value of the items.
