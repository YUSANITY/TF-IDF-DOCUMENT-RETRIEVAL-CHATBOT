What if I become jobless later for 1 year (and she did not remarry anyone during the period), do I have to top up the maintenance I owe her after I find a new job?","If you become jobless, then this may constitute a change of circumstances that may convince a court to vary the maintenance order. Until the order is varied, you will be obliged to pay her the full maintenance, including any arrears."
"My wife and I in the process of divorce. If she applies for maintenance from the subordinate courts of Singapore today, can she request for a backdated monthly maintainance, say starting from 1 year ago? Or will it only start from the date when the court",Singapore case law suggests that the Court can order maintenance to be back-dated to the date when the husband stopped providing for the wife. Whether the Court will do so is a question of fact.

However, there will be problems with the enforcement of this order if the father does not reside in Singapore."
"My ex-husband pays for child maintenance. I would like to take my children for holidays. Do my ex-husband pays for 100% of the trip including my holiday fare or just the fare relating to the children? Fare includes air ticket, hotel cost, food and expense","Child maintenance is usually fixed at a fixed sum and is not variable depending on your expenses. This all depends on the court order made upon the end of your marriage. Child maintenance does not include your expenses. That has to be covered under maintenance for an ex-spouse; again, the extent to which your ex-husband is liable to pay depends on the terms of the court order."
What factors does the Court consider in making a maintenance order?,"Factors that the Court will consider include: (i) the financial needs of the wife or child; (ii) the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the wife or child; (iii) any physical or mental disability of the wife or child; and (iv) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage."
Who can apply for maintenance?,"You can apply for maintenance (i) for your child from the other parent, if he or she neglects or refuses to provide your child with reasonable maintenance; (ii) for yourself from your husband, if you are a married woman whose husband neglects or refuses to provide you with reasonable maintenance; (iii) for yourself from your parent, if you are over 21 and you are still a full-time NSman or student."
What is maintenance?,Maintenance is financial support by your former spouse.

If you wish to pursue this option, you must have compelling evidence that can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that your ex-spouse deliberately disobeyed the access order. The punishment for contempt of court can include a fine or imprisonment.More information available at https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/what-happens-if-your-ex-spouse-does-not-give-you-access-to-your-child"
Will I be in disadvantages in terms of child custody if I am a permanent resident?,"In deciding the issue of custody, the courts in Singapore tend to accord both parents joint custody, barring exceptional circumstances.

I would like to know what is sole custody and joint custody ? Currently I am in a process of divorce and wants to have a clearer picture of sole and joint custody.,"The Singapore Courts generally grant 4 types of custody: sole custody order, joint custody order, hybrid order and split custody order. Under a sole custody order, the parent granted sole custody of the child will be the sole decision maker for major decisions concerning the child. Under a joint custody order, both parents will be decision makers for major decisions concerning the child. Both parents will therefore need to communicate with one another and reach a consensus where key decisions are concerned. In other words, both parents have an equal say in the upbringing of the child. For hybrid orders, although one parent will be granted custody over the child, the custodial parent must consult the non-custodial parent on matters pertaining to the welfare of the child. Under a split custody order, custody of different siblings may be split between the parents. This, however, is not a common order by the Court."

Joint custody allows you to make major decisions in your child's life, for eg, in his or her choice of school, religion, etc. However, by itself, joint custody does not assure you the right to visit your children on a regular basis. For that, you will need to have access rights granted by the court. As you have joint custody, it is likely that the court would also have made a decision on your access rights. Your right to visit your children will depend on the access rights granted by the court to you. As you have provided no details of such access rights, it is not possible for us to advise you on whether you can do what you have suggested."

Custody can be shared but care and control normally lies with one parent.The Court considers the welfare of the child (such as the child? s emotional and physical well-being) to be the most important factor when deciding custody, and care and control. Relevant factors include:-the role that each parent has played in the child? s life-the stability that each parent can offer the child-whether the child? s existing care arrangements can be left as they are-the child? s age: care and control of a very young child will normally lie with the mother-whether there are siblings: the Court tries if possible not to separate siblings-the child? s wishes, if he or she is old enough to express an independent opinion-the parent? s wishes, which comes second to the welfare of the child"

Depending on the amount, the Court or the police officer may allow more than one bailor for the person bailed.The surety or sureties who procure the release of the accused become responsible for his appearance when required at the stipulated time and place. The responsibility of a surety to ensure the attendance of the accused in court is very serious."

Can hotels refuse customers even if there is room available?,"Yes certainly. Although the general principle is that hotels are bound to provide accommodation for fee-paying customers, but they are not bound to do so at all risks and all costs. For a start, hotels are mandated by regulations to refuse rooms to persons of bad character. Further, hotels also cannot permit any gaming, drunkenness, drug abuse or disorderly conduct to take place on its premises. This probably means that the hotel can refuse customers who reasonably seem prone to exhibit such tendencies. Quite apart from those regulations, hotels can also refuse guests who are unwilling or unable to pay for a room or if the occupancy of the guests would exceed the hotel? s maximum capacity."
"For petty crimes like stealing a lighting fixture, can hotels sue the guests?","Yes, hotels can sue guests for stealing items that belong to the hotel. The civil action is known as the tort of conversion. The hotel can claim damages resulting from the unlawful possession of its property. The hotel can of course also lodge a police report. If the guest is successfully prosecuted, then he may be liable to a fine or imprisonment for up to three years under the terms of the Penal Code."
How hard is it to prove or disprove that something is stolen from a hotel room?,"It really depends on the facts. Where there is clear evidence of forced entry, then that is clear proof of theft. In one Singaporean case, the guests? jewellery box was found to have been smashed. In another case, the guests? suitcases were ransacked. These constitute clear proof of theft. On the other hand, where there is no sign of forced entry, theft will be harder to proof. Indeed, in such cases, the guest may himself have been careless so as to afford the thief the easy opportunity to steal without much force or effort."
What if you signed an agreement that hotel is not accountable for any loss of belongings? Are hotels allowed to do that?,"Singapore cases have held that such clauses are ineffective. This is because the basis of the hotel? s responsibility does not lie in a private contract between it and the guest. Rather, it is imposed upon the hotel as a matter of law and as such, the hotel cannot contract out of this requirement by way of a clause in a private agreement. At best, such notices is no more than a warning to the guest that they must do their part to take care of their things themselves."
Are hotels liable to the belongings of their guests? Up to what extend?,"Yes, they are, but the extent of their liability depends on the circumstances. In law, the hotel is regarded as insurer of the belongings of his guests. Therefore, if such belongings are lost or stolen within the confines of the hotel, the hotel must make good to its guests any damage or loss to the belongings. However, the hotel may not be liable for the full extent of the guests? loss. The hotel can escape liability if it can show that the guest himself was careless and that the carelessness led to the loss of the belongings. Another way in which the hotel can escape liability is if it has put up a display limiting its liability. This display must follow the terms of section 3(1) of Innkeepers? Act. Where the display is properly exhibited in a conspicuous part of the hotel, then, subject to very few exceptions, the hotel? s liability to its guests will be limited to $500 only. However, this display will not be effective in restricting the hotel? s liability when the theft occurred through its negligence or fault."

If they failed to do so, then they would be in breach. If the product is not regulated, then this depends on the terms of the contract you signed."

Is it legal to take over the monthly instalments of someone else's car?,"A car loan is governed by an agreement between the lender and the borrower. The borrower is usually the owner of the car. As with any agreement, the car loan agreement can be varied so that a third party ""takes over"" the obligation of paying the instalments for the car loan. However, this must be agreed to by the lender, the borrower and the third party. Alternatively, the borrower / owner of the car can enter into a private agreement with the third party under which the third party agrees with the borrower / owner of the car to pay the instalments for the car loan. In such a case, the lender is not involved and the private agreement is strictly a relationship between the borrower / owner of the car and the third party only. The borrower / owner of the car remains liable to repay the car loan to the lender under the original car loan agreement. Therefore, if the third party fails to pay the instalments, the lender can have recourse to the borrower / owner of the car and may exercise the rights (if any) under the car loan agreement to take possession of the car. The borrower / owner of the car will have to enforce the private agreement against the third party separately."
What if there is no written contract?,"It does not matter that the contract is not written. Contracts may be made orally or in writing. In addition, there need not be a formal contract as such; the agreement between the parties may be contained in a series of correspondence, such as emails or letters. Once there is an agreement between the parties, the ambit of the agreement must be determined. If the ambit is found to cover the issue in question, then there would be a breach if the supplier fails to provide goods or services provided for under the agreement. Even if the contract is silent on the quality of goods, various statutes imply the condition that the goods must be in sufficiently good condition or match their description. Hence, the lack of a written contract, or even the absence of specific terms as to the fitness of goods, is not necessarily fatal to a claim against a supplier for breach of contract."
"If the supplier supplies goods or services which do not match their description, can the consumer sue?","Yes, the consumer will be able to sue for breach of contract. If the contract provides a description of the goods or services to be provided, that is a term of the contract that has to be satisfied by the supplier. If the supplier does not satisfy those terms, he would have breached the contract. Such breach of contract enables the consumer to sue either int the Small Claims Tribunal or a higher level court if the claim amount is sufficiently large."
By when must the consumer commence any action under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act?,"Generally, the consumer must do so no later than 2 years from the date on which the unfair practice was alleged to take place."

The Small Claims Tribunal is empowered by the Act to order the return of any money, property or any other item given by the consumer to the supplier; award the consumer damages to compensate for loss suffered as a result of the unfair practice; or direct the supplier to do certain acts to ensure that the consumer obtains the true value of his or her bargain."
Does a consumer have any recourse against a supplier of goods or services who omits to provide key information?,Yes. The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act accords the consumer some level of protection. A consumer who has been misled or deceived by the supplier of goods or services can sue the supplier for unfair practice.  ?Unfair practice? is defined widely under the Act and generally includes instances where the supplier? s silence amounts to misleading or deception of the consumer.
"A widower re-marries an Indonesian lady. Upon his death, the Indonesian lady went back to her home country (she's not a SPR nor SG citizen), without contact details. What happens to the property and his savings account all under his own name?","If the deceased left behind a valid will, then the executor will carry out his instructions. If the deceased died without a will (also known as dying intestate), then Singapore's rules on intestate succession will determine the distribution of the deceased's estate (see section 7 of the Intestate Succession Act for the rules on distribution). Therefore, either the deceased's will or the rules on intestate succession will govern the distribution of the deceased's estate.You should note that certain property may not form part of the deceased's estate.

First, if A&C; do not ever find out about the monies in the account, then they will not make a claim. Second, if they do find out, then it is for them to prove that the monies actually belongs to your mother. If they can, then the monies would properly be divided intestate which is effectively equally between all children. We suggest that your mother does a will if she wishes to avoid all risk."

The main advantage to having a lawyer present (especially if the lawyer drafted the will) is that the lawyer can explain the contents of the will. That being said, the lawyer's explanation is not binding - he is just explaining his understanding of the will. If a dispute occurs as to the contents of the will (or the validity of the will), then the contents of the will speaks for itself and the beneficiaries will have to sort it out (in court or otherwise)."

For example, the company will be rightfully entitled to the insurance payout if it is the named beneficiary of the insurance policy. A common scenario for this is where the company takes out a key??person insurance policy.On the other hand, the policy may be taken out for the benefit of the company's employees (assuming the deceased was an employee). If so, then the insurance proceeds form part of the deceased's estate. The Insurance Act allows insurers to either pay to the insured/employer or to those entitled through the insured/employer to receive such payments i.e. the deceased. As the insurer has paid the insurance proceeds, the employer owes the same to the deceased's estate.The distribution of the deceased's estate will depend on his will. If the deceased did not leave behind a will, the distribution of assets will follow the rules laid down in the Intestate Succession Act."

Hence, if that is not the case, then provided that the mother is not a managerial or executive position who earns a basic monthly salary of more than $4,500, she would only be entitled to 12 weeks maternity leave (8 weeks paid/4 weeks unpaid).She would not be entitled to baby bonus in any event as that requires that the mother be lawfully married."

Note that this notice period applies for your employer as well  ? your employer needs to pay you the same amount to terminate your employment immediately as well. It may be possible to avoid paying the  ?three month average salary? sum if this term in the contract is deemed to be a penalty clause. A clause is an unenforceable penalty where it is not a genuine pre-estimate of loss. Otherwise, any sum payable in a contract that is a genuine pre-estimate of loss is not a penalty and is therefore enforceable. However, the payment stipulated in your contract (three months of salary) does not seem to be a penalty clause as it is likely a genuine pre-estimate of loss for the employer."

If there is a very large difference between the actual loss suffered by the company and the contractual sum, you may wish to consult a lawyer as the contractual term may be unenforceable as a penalty. If the sum was not stipulated in the contract, then the burden is on the company to prove that it had incurred a loss due to the breach of the contract."

Otherwise, any sum payable in a contract that is a genuine pre-estimate of loss is not a penalty and must be paid. However, the payment stipulated in your contract (two months of salary) does not seem to be a penalty clause as it is likely a genuine pre-estimate of loss for the employer. As such, if you do wish to terminate your employment contract, you will likely have to pay the agreed sum."

As small tribunal court does not have Lawyers, will the agency be able to have a lawyer present them and sue me elsewhere","Lawyers are not allowed to represent any of the parties in Small Claims Tribunals proceedings. The recruitment firm therefore cannot be represented by a lawyer at the Hearing. The recruitment firm can be represented by a lawyer if it appeals against the decision made by the Small Claims Tribunal Registrar, Assistant Registrar or Referee who has heard the matter. The recruitment firm may only appeal against an order from the Small Claims Tribunal to the High Court in limited circumstances: on any ground involving a question of law; or on the ground that the claim was outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It is unlikely that leave (permission) will be given to the recruitment firm to make such an appeal to the High Court.As regards the penalty of one month? s salary, it is possible to avoid paying if this term in the contract is deemed to be a penalty clause.

"If contract stated cannot tender resignation till 30Jun and i resign with 2 months notice, last day 31 Jul, do i break bond n needs to compensate?","It depends on your specific employment contract. Most importantly, you should check if your contract provides for any remedies or damages if you were to tender resignation before 30th June.

As such, if you do wish to terminate your employment contract, you will likely have to pay the agreed sum."

"If I declare bankrupt, and my wife is waiting for her citizenship ceremony,to take her pink IC on hand.she already had a Singapore passport but she only got a temporary slip to prove that she has a Singapore IC. Will my declaration of bankrupt affect her","It is unlikely that your financial status would affect your wife's citizenship.

It must be the  ?clearest of cases? that the original owner has  ?a specific and unequivocal intention? to abandon the property in question. In your situation, the most relevant factors likely are the nature of the items and the value of the items. If the items were of low monetary value and your ex-girlfriend has not shown any intention to reclaim them, then likely she would be considered to have abandoned the items. The two years between the break-up and her request would likely add to your case, assuming that she has not contacted you during the past two years regarding her items."
